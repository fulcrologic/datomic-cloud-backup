  "AWS implementation of a BackupStore on S3.

   NOTES:

   * Since s3 is eventually consistent it is possible that any reported data from
   methods like `last-segment-info` are incorrect. This should be ok in most cases because backing up
   a segment is an idempotent operation.
   * S3 bills by request.
   ** Choosing a small number of transactions per segment leads to more PUT requests.
   ** The `last-segment-info` is the cheapest way to figure out where to resume, since
   it is a single request. Using `saved-segment-info` lists all objects in the store, and can result
   in a lot of requests and network overhead.
